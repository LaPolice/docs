Introduction to RoboFont Extensions
===================================

RoboFont users can choose from many open-source Extensions developed and maintained by different designers. Each extension adds a special functionality or interface which is not available by default in RoboFont. Using Python, users can also build their own extensions.

Installing extensions
---------------------

Extensions can be installed with just one double-click. Depending on the extension, a new entry may appear under the *Extensions* menu, or a new icon may be added to *Tools* palette in the Glyph Window. Different extensions behave differently.

Un-installing extensions
------------------------

Extensions can be easily removed in the *Preferences* window, or by double-clicking the extension bundle again.
