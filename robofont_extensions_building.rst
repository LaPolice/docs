Building Extensions
===================

Anatomy of RoboFont extensions
------------------------------

Extensions are simple bundles of files, including Python scripts, meta-information files and additional resources such as images -- all packaged into a folder with the extension :doc:`.roboFontExt <roboFontDocumentation/content/extensions/specification>`.

Documentation in HTML format can also be included for the user, and can be accessed with RoboFontâ€™s own *Help Window*.

Using the Extensions Builder
----------------------------

RoboFont also has a special dialog to facilitate packaging Extensions, the :doc:`Extensions Builder <roboFontDocumentation/content/extensions/building>`.

Building extensions with a script
---------------------------------

It is also possible to build an extension with a script, using the appropriate RoboFont API. For an example, have a look at the `build script for the hTools2 extension <https://github.com/gferreira/hTools2_extension/blob/master/build-RF-extension.py>`_.
